And last but not least: data analysis is really fun!

% FEEDBACK
% From class:
% Maybe there is not reverse causality...maybe roads are better?  Is it possible to get into this?  Seems too "broad" (pun intended)....
% Maybe also control for fixed effects of particular countries...beyond just SSA or latin america.
% Control for levels of crime and corruption, expense of broadband, etc.
% Look at economic/sociological reasons or links -- why should we expect a link between broadband and GDP?
% Difficult to fix the reverse causality things...find something correlated to GDP but not broadband then correct for that... “Instrumental variable”
% Turn broadband into a binary (available or not) vs. continuous variable.

% - Just wondering if primary school enrollment is a good proxy for an outcome that seeks to correlate growth with internet penetration. High school might be more relevant? This is a gut feeling and not an informed comment, I must admit
