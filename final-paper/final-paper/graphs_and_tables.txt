Have now:
  - Main "BBND" table: <coefficient> | <t-stat>
  - Large regression table (-1): all variables

Easy:
  - Table defining variables


Sort of easy:
  - growth effects of ICT: fixed, mobile, inet, broadband
    The y axis represents the percentage-point increase in economic growth per
    10-percentage-point increase in telecommunications penetration. All
    results are statistically significant at the 1 percent level except for
    that of broadband in developing countries, which is at the 10 percent
    level

Hard:
   - cost of broadband penetration
