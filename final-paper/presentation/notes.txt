Instructions:
  your title; your name(s); your main question/s in the paper (I mean something
  that ends grammatically with a question mark, not a broad theme of interest);
  your case / location and *salient* info on case, if you are using a case; your
  main methods -- data analysis, lit review, both, or, if the paper is a
  proposal, what methods you think you will use eventually; your expected
  conclusions; your hoped for contribution. If you have no location or case
  (e.g. if you are doing a review paper) that's fine. You do not have to prepare
  one slide per topic I have mentioned, but you want to cover these in your
  talk. Of course you're thinking -- what does she think? Who would put up a
  talk without a title and their name? Answer: Many. But now, of course, not
  you.

Content:
 - Question: does broadband Internet connectivity actually spur economic
   growth?

 - What do I mean by that?:
   - Broadband: "high bandwidth" connections, not just mobile. Enough to watch
     a video on
   - Economic growth: GDP

 - This is the underlying motivation of a number of researchers, including
   TIER, UCSB, ... TODO(cs): add NGO's, GO's, etc.
   - Also drives many policy decisions (citations at begnning of Quiang paper)

 - Previous work: Quiang

 - Data: ITU and World Bank
   - Include graphs of the variables, and mention that you generated those
     graphs.
   - BTW, it's awesome data to play with!
   - Note that the purpose of the other variables is largely to discount other
     hypotheses

 - Model: endogenous growth.

    - Note: I am not an economist! I'm reverse engineering most of what you
      see here, so feel more than welcome to correct me if I'm misrepresenting
      something. -> Slide of 'I have no idea what I'm doing!' dog

 - Initial findings:

 - Shortcomings

/**
From the paper:
---------------
Because demand for telecommunications services rises
with wealth, the impact of increased telecommunications penetration on
economic growth and the impact of rising per capita GDP on the demand for
telecommunications constitute the so-called two-way causality issue.
Especially in the cases of mobile, Internet, and broadband, where data are
only available starting 1990 or later (1998 in the case of broadband),
penetration rates are potentially endogenous. The growth model approach does
not deal with this problem explicitlyâ€”we performed a Hausman test to determine
whether any reverse causality is present. We used the initial values of
telecommunications penetrations as the instruments. The null hypothesis of
ordinary least squares being consistent and efficient could not be rejected

 - Other questions I want to ask given enough time
   - Just wondering if primary school enrollment is a good proxy for an outcome that seeks to correlate growth with Internet penetration. High school might be more relevant? This is a gut feeling and not an informed comment, I must admit.
   - Also wondering what the cost of 10% broadband penetration might be even if it does "lead to" 1.3% growth; what else might lead to 1.3% growth and is broadband cost-effective in comparison? This is NOT the point of your paper but I think it's worth considering for future ICT-or-not-for-D policy.
