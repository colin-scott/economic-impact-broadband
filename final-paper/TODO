- Email eecs-misc to ask about macro-economics

Econ:
 - "Penetration rates are potentially endogenous". Wat?
 - Hausman test
 - t-statistic
 - Null hypothesis
 - -1th, -2th, .. indicators
 - 10% stat significance is worse than 1%? Don't understand statistical
   significance well enough
 - Precise definition of human capital stock, and why it matter for the endogenous
   model
 - "Consistent with the convergence implication of the neoclassical growth
   model, the coefficients on these variables were significant."
 - "once longer periods of data are avail- able on broadband penetration, a
   subperiod analysis could be conducted, thus establishing multiple data
   points for each economy in an endogenous growth regression."

Data:
 - Re-visit comparison with mobile growth rates?
 - Look at *cost* of broadband deployment
