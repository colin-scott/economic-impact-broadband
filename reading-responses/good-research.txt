Burrell and Toyama:
  - Although I was marginally aware of this before, this paper made it very clear
    to me how young the field of ICTD is. It seems that the ICTD community has relatively
    little common agreement on research values and assumptions, and relatively
    strong and persistent disagreements about the community's goals.
  - The points of interdisciplinary agreement (and disagreement) outlined in
    this paper seemed intuitive (it seems that most sciences would agree that
    these goals are important?)
  - I personally have not ever been exposed to a multi-disciplinary field such
    as ICTD. I wonder if it is possible at all for a multi-disciplinary field
    to become a mature science? It seems (following Kuhn) that a young science
    requires that the community hold a widely accepted set of assumptions before
    it can go into the "puzzle-solving" stage of refining those assumptions.
    Yet in a multi-disciplinary field, there is an inevitable disagreement over
    the most fundamental assumptions (e.g. realism vs. interpertivism)
  - That said, perhaps it's not such a bad thing that ICTD may never become a
    mature science :)
  - On a tangential note: the epistemology of ICTD is still very unclear to me. It seems that ICTD
    research often (consciously) conflates two goals:
      - aiding disadvantaged people
      - gaining knowledge of human social dynamics

    It's not clear that it's possible to achieve those goals concurrently!
    Why don't we don't we focus on one or the other? It seems that by focusing
    on both at once, we may do a poor job of achieving either one.


Khalil and Kenny:
   - I honestly had a hard time distilling a thesis from this paper. It
     appears to be a smattering of observations about:
     - the pervasiveness of mobile technology in the developing world
     - which in turn, implies that most of the growth in deployment is
       occurring in the developing world
     - which in turn implies that innovative business models are coming out of
       the developing world.
     - yet there are some barriers to innovation, such as antiquated and
       inefficient wireless spectrum regulation institutions, and lack of
       competition for backbone bandwidth
