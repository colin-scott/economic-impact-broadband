I'm going to focus on the debate between Banerjee and Mookherjee, since I
honestly didn't find the other two papers particularly interesting (we've seen
many example of failed ICT projects throughout the course, and it's not clear
to me that these are any different).

The debate between Banerjee and Mookherjee centers around the question of
whether the development research community should focus their attention on
theory or empirical analysis.

Mookherjee claims that empirical analysis *without* theoretical backing is
not productive. He starts by examining historical examples of this same
debate between theorist and empiricist in other subfields of economics.
Previously, theorists have argued that experiments without sufficient
theoretical backing:
  - have inherent biases
  - often makes unfounded theoretical assumptions themselves
  - don't generalize at all, in the sense that they don't serve to confirm or
    deny any general theoretical framework

As a result of these shortcoming, theorists have argued that the results of
unfounded experiments often don't show anything beyond a very constrained data
set that is very hard to interpret.

Mookherjee then argues that sciences often go through four stages of
development:
  i. empirical description of phenomena
  ii. formulation of relevant theory
  iii. testing of theories
  iv. use the least unsuccessful theory to make predictions

Mookherjee asserts that the field of development is not prepared to move to
stage iv. That is, more time should be spent developing theories (which
engender new ideas). If we hastily move to stage iv., we risk having
experiments be very limited in scope, only verifying specific interventions,
and not generalizing to principles of policy.

Abhijit takes the opposite tack, and is largely in favor of focusing our
efforts on empirical studies.

He first argues for the value of experiments:
 - our intuitions can't possibly account for all the relevant
variables (e.g. ring worms turned out to be more problematic for education than
lack of teachers, something that theorists would never have been able to
predict).
 - Being "on the ground" gives researchers a feedback loop with practitioners on the
   ground, allowing us to refine the parameters of our experiments iteratively.

Abhijit also defends criticisms against empiricism, pointing out that:
 - the criticisms aren't specific to randomized control trials, and
 - the criticisms don't engage directly with the valuable aspects of experiments

Discussion:
 - It's not clear to me that Abhijit arguments in favor of eschewing theory
   apply to countries that are not at the bottom of the pyramid. We have a
   much better sense of the involved variables, don't we?

 - All of this debate between theory vs. empiricism seems odd to me. If you
   look at a mature scientific field like physics, both are clearly necessary,
   and symbiotic! Why do we need to make a black and white distinction between
   theory and practice? Moreover, these arguments seem quite childish to me --
   we're on the same side here!

 - Perhaps Mookherjee is right though; the very fact that we're arguing about
   this indicates that the field of development is nascent.
